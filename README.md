# Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering aims at learning predictive models of user preferences, interests or behavior from community data. In this project, we report on our experience scaling up collaborative filtering using cloud computing and a Spark framework. In particular, we describe our approach for generating personalized recommendations using variants of the MovieLens data set. Our solution efficiently distributes computation in parallel and is relatively simple to implement.
